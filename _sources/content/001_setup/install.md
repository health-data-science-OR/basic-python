# Install python and an IDE

The code in this book is written in standard Python 3.8.

## Local installation

For beginners it is is recommended that users first install 'Anaconda'. This bundles python along with data science centric IDEs called `Spyder` and `Jupyter notebook`.

> Anaconda includes 'conda' (a package manager).  An optional step is to follow our notes to use [conda](conda.md) to create a virtual environment that includes python 3.8 and Jupyter-Lab 3.

## Run our code via Binderhub or Google Colab

```{note}
You have the option of running our code in the cloud without the need to install on your local machine.
```

When you navigate the either the lectures of practical labs you will see a image of a 'rocketship' in the top right hand corner of the screen.  Move you mouse over the image and you can choose to either open the notebook in BinderHub (will take ~1 minute to open) or Google Colab (requires a Google account).
